          were, it would be a bad book. You can't be everyone's friend, because
          everyone is different. You'd have to be completely lacking in
          personality, no rough edges or sharp corners. But even then, many
          people wouldn't like you, because they need rough edges and sharp
          corners. Do you understand? Every person needs different books.
          Because what one person loves with all their heart, might leave
          another completely cold.”
